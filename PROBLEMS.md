# Problem Statements
## **Health Care Track**

### **1. Disease Prediction and Medication Suggestion**

**Category:** Health Care

Develop a system that predicts one disease (choose from Skin Disease, Lung/Breast Cancer, Diabetes, Brain Tumor, or Alzheimer’s) using patient data and suggests safe, explainable actions or next steps.

**Background Context:**
Early diagnosis saves lives, but expert access is limited. AI-based predictions can help detect risks early and assist doctors in decision-making.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Machine learning model for disease detection
* Dashboard displaying prediction results and suggested actions

---

### **2. Low-Bandwidth Teleconsultation App**

**Category:** Health Care

Design a lightweight teleconsultation app that works smoothly even on unstable or low internet connections. It should allow patients to connect with doctors and receive prescriptions digitally.

**Background Context:**
Many rural areas struggle with poor connectivity, making healthcare inaccessible. A low-data app can make telemedicine more inclusive.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Real-time chat or audio call system
* Secure prescription sharing and offline access

---

### **3. Smart Patient Record & Reminder System**

**Category:** Health Care

Create a web-based system that stores patient records and automatically reminds patients of upcoming appointments or lab tests.

**Background Context:**
Missed appointments and lost records affect treatment efficiency. Automated notifications help maintain continuity in patient care.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Centralized patient record system
* Automated email/SMS/WhatsApp reminders

---

## **Education Track**

### **4. Interactive Code Learning Platform**

**Category:** Education

Build a platform where students can write code (Python or JavaScript), execute it live, and get hints or explanations for errors.

**Background Context:**
New learners often get stuck debugging code. An interactive learning tool can make programming more engaging and beginner-friendly.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Online code editor with live execution
* Hint and explanation system for errors

---

### **5. AI-Powered Tutor Chatbot**

**Category:** Education

Develop an AI chatbot that answers questions in subjects like math, science, or history and explains each concept clearly, step-by-step.

**Background Context:**
Students often need on-demand help with learning. An AI tutor can make studying interactive, fast, and accessible.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Chat interface for subject-based queries
* AI-generated step-by-step answers with examples

---

### **6. Voice Assistant for Learning**

**Category:** Education

Build a mobile voice assistant that helps students learn through conversation. It should listen, understand, and reply with voice — even on limited internet.

**Background Context:**
Voice technology can make education more accessible, especially for young learners or those with reading difficulties.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Voice input and output interface
* Conversational Q&A for study-related topics

---

### **7. AI Model for Student Retention**

**Category:** Education

Develop an ML model that identifies students at risk of dropping out based on attendance, grades, and engagement data.

**Background Context:**
Schools and universities struggle to identify students in need of help early. Predictive models can support proactive intervention.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Trained model predicting dropout probability
* Visualization or report showing risk levels

---

### **8. Smart Education Summarizer**

**Category:** Education

Create a web tool that summarizes long lecture notes or PDFs and automatically generates key points, quizzes, and MCQs.

**Background Context:**
Students waste time revising lengthy materials. AI summarization tools can make studying faster and more focused.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Upload and summarize feature for notes
* Auto-generated quiz and MCQ section

---

## **Energy & Climate Change Track**

### **9. Climate Data Visualization Tool**

**Category:** Energy & Climate Change

Build a system that visualizes past climate data such as temperature and rainfall, showing how patterns have changed across regions and time.

**Background Context:**
Climate change is better understood when seen. Visualization helps people explore trends and grasp real impacts.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Interactive dashboard with climate data graphs
* Region and timeline-based filtering options

---

### **10. Real-Time Climate Disaster Information System**

**Category:** Energy & Climate Change

Communities lack easy access to real-time climate disaster updates, making it hard to respond effectively.
Build a system that provides real-time climate alerts, educational resources, and response insights through an interactive interface.

**Background Context:**
Quick access to accurate disaster data can save lives and reduce damage.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Real-time event tracker
* Alert and educational resource modules

**Hint:** Use OpenWeatherMap or NASA Earth APIs.

---

### **11. Sustainability Fitness App**

**Category:** Energy & Climate Change

Create a mobile or web app that encourages users to walk or cycle and shows how their actions help reduce CO₂ emissions.

**Background Context:**
Encouraging small lifestyle changes can make a big impact on climate awareness and health.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Fitness tracking with CO₂ savings visualization
* Daily or weekly activity tracking and insights

**Hint:** Use Google Fit or Carbon Footprint APIs.

---

### **12. Personal Carbon Footprint Tracker**

**Category:** Energy & Climate Change

Develop a tool where users input daily habits (transport, meals, electricity usage) and get an estimate of their carbon footprint with suggestions to reduce it.

**Background Context:**
Awareness of personal carbon impact motivates individuals to adopt greener lifestyles.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Carbon footprint calculator
* Personalized tips to reduce impact

---

## **Agriculture Track**

### **13. Crop Price Prediction Dashboard**

**Category:** Agriculture

Build a web dashboard that predicts future crop prices using historical market and weather data.

**Background Context:**
Unpredictable crop prices affect farmers’ income. Forecasting can help them make better selling decisions.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* ML-based crop price forecasting
* Data visualization dashboard

---

### **14. Farmer-to-Buyer Marketplace**

**Category:** Agriculture

Create a web platform that connects farmers directly with buyers, allowing transparent and profitable transactions.

**Background Context:**
Middlemen often reduce farmer profits. A direct marketplace empowers farmers and ensures fair pricing.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Product listing, search, and chat modules
* Buyer-seller interaction dashboard

---

### **15. Smart Farming Assistant**

**Category:** Agriculture

Develop a digital assistant that provides weekly farming advice based on real-time weather updates.

**Background Context:**
Farming decisions are often weather-dependent. Timely data helps farmers plan irrigation, sowing, and harvesting effectively.

**Expected Deliverables:**

* Weather-integrated farm assistant
* Notifications or recommendations section

**Hint:** Use OpenWeatherMap or Open-Meteo APIs.
